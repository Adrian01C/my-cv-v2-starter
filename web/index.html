        <p class="text-description">I’m Alexandra, baby software developer at Codetapacademy by master Marian Zburlea. Well, about me, I love programming: it’s kind of building amazing things just using a text editor. I remember since I was a child I have been excited about this new digital world and very curious to discover what is behind the screen. And here I am, after so many years under the wing of my old friend and now a teacher.Marian Zburlea with his help I will sink into the abyss of the web. 
          Now I have a pretty good level of web technologies: HTTP servers, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (both from Node.js and the web browser), although I’m focused on React. I think I love this project.</p>
